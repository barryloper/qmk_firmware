current wishlist
-------------------------
dual or thumb shift (done)
numpad
left-handed integers (at least 1-5)

ideas
---------------
far bottom left triggers numpad
numbers on home row
arrows on home row?
maybe enter on thumb somewhere
home/end should be somewhere
hitting shift to get anything but caps doesn't seem intuitive when there are layer buttons
maybe I have a caps layer? maybe nothing that is on a non-default layer is shiftable
things you commonly type with numbers, (,.=+*/-) should be available on the same layer
probably on a transparent layer so, for example, you don't have to lift the upper key when typing period
things like shift+, makes < are at odds with other keys like lower+k makes = and upper+k makes =.
questions
--------------
where should enter go? (left space for now)
what about delete (lower/upper backspace)
caps lock definitely needed (maybe not with thumb shift) double-tap either shift

notes
--------------
edit planck/keymaps/barry/keymap.c
run make planck/rev4:barry
run flip to flash the .hex file
profit
